# NummonCalc
A script to add a new tab to Kittens Game containing the results of many calculation functions, to help players.

To use, just copy the contents of NummonCalc.js to your browser console (Google for how to pull that up if you're not sure). A new tab should appear at the top. Presto, you're done!
